- BackTracking

Recurssive Algorithm Technique for solving problems incremently by tryinh partial solution and then abandoning them (backtracking) if they fail to satisfy the condition constraints


" Explorring all posiblities but beinf smart by abandoning wrong paths early"

ex : maze experience

When to use backtracking 

: combination/ permutation/ subsets

: Partial Solution 

: is too large to bruteforce , 

Optimize recurssion 


All the combination to get the sum example . Because here we need to find all the combination so we cam do this.
Pruning the path
